This is a sample file for testing sentence boundary detection (SBD).
- inputs are in text.deu.03.txt
- outputs are in text.deu.03.sent.txt

Input and output files may have paragraphs.
It depends on SBD algorithm whether or not paragraph information is taken into
account when doing SBD. Meanwhile in the output file, paragraphs (empty lines
separating paragraphs) are only for convenience.

Output file must contain exactly one sentence per line. Sentences are expected
in the same order as they appear in the input file.

Description of phenomena in input file:
- one sentence is already a line
- one sentence is on its own line and it does not end with a final PM
- several sentences per line
- a sentence spans more that one line
