# text from wikipedia about Black Holes
## Part 1, a
A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing — no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light — can escape from it .
## Part 1, b
The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole .
The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon .
### Part 2, b
Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it , it has no locally detectable features .
In many ways , a black hole acts like an ideal black body , as it reflects no light .
