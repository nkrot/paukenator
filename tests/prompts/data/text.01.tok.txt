# text from wikipedia about Black Holes
A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing — no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light — can escape from it .
The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole .
The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon .
